# Integrating-LLaMA-Language-Model-with-FLUX-Pipeline-for-Enhanced-Image-and-Text-Generation
This project explores the integration of the LLaMA language model with the FLUX pipeline, combining state-of-the-art text and image generation capabilities into a cohesive system. The LLaMA model, known for its powerful natural language processing and text generation, is used in conjunction with the FLUX pipeline, a diffusion-based image synthesis.
